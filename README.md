# Philippine Agencies Web Scraper

This project is a beginner-friendly web scraper that extracts a list of Philippine government agencies from the FOI website and saves it into a CSV file.

It was created as part of my learning journey to strengthen programming skills while working on a practical, real-world use case involving data extraction and cleaning.

Features
- Retrieves agency data from a live website
- Parses HTML and embedded JSON
- Cleans and formats agency names
- Saves results into a UTF-8 encoded CSV file

Skills Practiced
- Python basics (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Web scraping (Requests, BeautifulSoup)
- JSON parsing and data extraction
- File handling (CSV writing)
- Basic data cleaning techniques

How It Works
1. Send a request to the FOI agencies page
2. Extract the embedded JSON containing agency information
3. Clean and format the extracted agency names
4. Save the cleaned list into a CSV file
